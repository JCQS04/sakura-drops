### Sakura Drops

Experiment with HTML5 Canvas, various common libraries and my own set of JS 
wrappers and utilities, aka hlf-vjs.

This started as a Processing sketch, but I'm a fan of dynamic, functional 
languages like JS, so I'm in the process of porting and finishing it. 

The original effects were pretty much analog. [Utada's husband](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Kazuaki-Kiriya/47364771385)
directed, and he has a unique aesthetic I enjoy. You can see the video [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlwCZm2MQbQ); 
not a fan of some of the 3d stuff, but otherwise nice.
